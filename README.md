# PathFinder
An A* pathfinder assignment made with C# and WPF which reads a text file and shows the best path in the UI

This is a Visual Studio 2022 C# WPF project. 

The folder PenttiMaze/executable contains the executable PenttiMaze.exe and the text files given with the assignment.
When the executable is run, it looks for a maze file in the same folder with the name 'maze.txt'.
If another file should be used, it should be renamed to 'maze.txt' and put into the same folder.
